This is just a fun project. Download all the files in a single folder and run index.html to play
Or you can play the game at https://slayerdraco.github.io/Mines-Game/
I will try to make it a working app later on.
Also If anyone knows how to code the 'Autoplay function', Please fork this repo and make another one. I will surely mention you.
